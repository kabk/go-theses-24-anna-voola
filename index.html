	This thesis explores the transformative power of storytelling, using
	mouldy bread as an analogy to describe the power and entanglement of
	storytelling. 
	
	<br/>
	<br/>
	
	Stories, just alike an airborne fungus in bread,
	infiltrates the greater narrative of the world, influencing the discourse
	and the shaping of perceptions. 
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Focused on the overlooked narratives of the
	female experience, this thesis challenges the dominance of the white cis
	male-dominated stories. Further, it explores methods within the realm of
	literature and fiction and how to share experiences by the unwanted and
	suppressed voices through history.


	<br/>
	<br/>
		
	
	The concept of the evolving archive, similar to the mouldy bread or
	an unopened Tupperware, challenges conventional perceptions of archives
	as being rigid and controlled spaces. This thesis proposes a shift
	towards healing inequalities and emphasizing the importance of embracing
	diverse stories. Ultimately, storytelling emerges as a dynamic tool for
	rewriting and detangling the master narrative.

<br/>
<br/>
  
<p>
I once heard, that if your bread has mould at one spot, you can’t just scrape it — or cut it — away, 
like you would do with your cheese or
vegetables. You would have to throw the entire loaf of bread away, even
though the rest of it hasn’t been touched by the mould at all.
</p>


	

<p>
Since the mould apparently is airborne and bread being rather porous the
mould would travel incredibly fast through the entire body of the loaf,
and by the time you notice the fuzzy, green, and white spores in the
corner of your bread, the microscopic <button class="button1 image-toggle" data-image-id="image-1">threads</button> of the fungi will already
have woven itself into the entire loaf.




<span class="italic">And by now it would be far too late to even
think about eating a single crumb of the loaf of bread.</span>

</p>



<br/>
<br/>


<p>
In many ways I see stories to be just like that <button class="button1 image-toggle" 
data-image-id="image-3">airborne fungus</button>.

As a story is being told, being brought to life, and in some way being
planted in this world — no matter being the bedtime stories told from the
side of the bed, or it being incredible literary work about the female
experience — it immediately infiltrates the greater narrative of the
world. It travels into the gaps of the untoldness and fills it up with
new knowledge and perceptions. You might not be able to see it, or feel
it instantly, but the threads of the story are going to affect the
discourse, and make the world interconnected across multiple different events and experiences.
</p>

<br/>
It might sound a bit farfetched at this point, but this is the
power that storytelling contains, the power to change and shake up our
perception of the world — no matter the story being big or small — it can
(or will) eventually lead to a change.
Storytelling protects and maintains endlessness and ongoingness of the
world, and for everyday passing, more and more stories come to life. The
threads of the stories tangle itself into the empty spaces of the
greater&nbsp;narrative. This makes it rather impossible to cover every aspect
of the tool of storytelling and therefore in this thesis, my exploring
and curiosity stems from an interest in speculative fabulation,
speculative feminism, science fiction — or just SF, a term I have borrowed from Donna&nbsp;Haraway.

Haraway argues that none of these listed genres can exist without each other

tangles and patterns, to pass on and to receive, to make and to unmake,
and to pick up the threads and to drop them again.

The urge and motivation for this theme is to investigate the

interconnects and how this has contributed to the shaping of the world

It’s not going to be possible to write about the significance of
storytelling and how it is intertwined with the female experience,
without mentioning Ursula K. Le Guin and her novel <button class="button1 image-toggle" data-image-id="image-6">The Carrier Bag
Theory of Fiction</button>. In her writings Le Guin presents us the idea,
that the stories we know of — and have been told numerous of times already — are the stories
that are centered around the greatest adventures and heroes. 
</p>

<p>
Since the stories of prehistoric
times, we have been fed with stories of the brave hunter who went out on
dangerous adventure, defying the extreme weather and risking their life, for then to come back
home with the meat of his prey — and for him to then become the man who survived
to tell the story. Le Guin refers this phenomenon in storytelling and fiction as <em>The Killer Story</em>
  

<span class="sidenote-wrapper">
    <input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-checkbox" />
    <label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"> </label>
    <span class="sidenote">The term ‘The Killer Story’ is used by Ursula K. Le Guin to refer to 
		the stories that revolves around heroes and the great victory of surviving. 
		These kind of narratives are often neglecting the diverse perspectives from what could be referred 
		to as ‘real people’ who live the standard ordinary life of the given time.</span>
</span>




and more importantly goes on by saying
<span class="quote">“It isn’t their story. It’s his”.</span>


<span class="reference-toggle">&nbsp;&#x27A5;</span>
<span class="reference">(Le Guin et al. <em>The Carrier

</p>


<p> 
<br/>
One could wonder why history has been so hyper fixated on the story of the hunter?... Especially since the prehistoric human
didn’t survive from hunting, but rather
gathering of grains and berries — and in the end, the hunting was no necessity. 
But collecting oats and grains is harder to make interesting and probably less
thrilling to listen to than to the tale of taking down a mammoth in extreme weather. 
This of course doesn’t mean that stories of the collector are any less important — far from. 
</p>


<p> 
Le Guin argues that what we know, from prehistoric time and this way of living, is that the 
first manmade tool wasn’t a <button class="button1 image-toggle" data-image-id="image-5">deathly weapon</button>, 
but rather a container to collect and&nbsp;contain.

<br/>
<p>
A container — a tool that can carry everything and be anything; from a
womb carrying a child, to the woven basket storing the food that has
been collected, to the novelle that holds the story, that then carries
the words. To the words carrying knowledge.
<span class="reference-toggle">&#x27A5;</span>
<span class="reference">(Ibid.)</span>

Words works like microorganisms — when they get planted, the threads of them interconnects
with each other, and by then starts to communicate and create kinship
through patterns and entanglements in the greater narrative.
<span class="italic">And never have I ever thought that I would find my Tupperware
so poetic; look at me gazing at
the food that has been shook in my bag and become one uniform, dense
matter. I can store it and take it with me — I can move energy. Just like
my words can — spoken and written.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe to fully understand the female experience your first
step is to enjoy and value the tool of the Tupperware?
</p>
</span>

<br/>
<br/>

<p>
On the other hand, the stories that have no heroes, but are filled up
with real people, is by Le Guin being referred to as <em>The Life
Story</em>

		</span>
</span>



Which I, for the purpose
of this thesis, translate into the story of the female experience — or
maybe rather the lack of it.

<br/>
<br/>




<span class="quote">
“The society, the civilisation they were talking about, these
theoreticians [Freud etc.], was evidently theirs; they owned it, they
liked it; they were human, fully human, bashing, sticking, thrusting,
killing. Wanting to be human too, I sought for evidence that I was; but
if what it took, to make a weapon and kill with it, then
evidently I was either extremely defective as a human, or not human
at all…”

“…That’s right, they said. What you are is a woman.”

<span class="reference">(Ibid., p. 30-32)</span>




<br />
<br />

This quote emphasises my allegation — that we are all born directly into a
main narrative, prefabricated for only the hero — or the man/the male
experience — to succeed. And history are full of evidence for this claim.

<br />
<br />

The very earliest documented stories are told to be explored in cave
paintings, dated all the way back to the Paleolithic epoch, some would
address this to be, relatively, in the very beginning. As already
mentioned, during this time humans survived on gathered food.
</p>


<p>
But I’m guessing — unless you are highly interested in prehistoric
times — that you might thought of spears, and men hunting mammals and
other extinct wild animals. You are thinking of men running with deathly
weapons and saving the day with the meat of their prey. 
<br/>
<br/>
I’m not saying that
you are a supporter of the patriarchy


<span class="sidenote-wrapper">
    <input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-checkbox" />
    <label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"> </label>
    <span class="sidenote">Patriarchy is a social system where men are the authority. 
		This idea stems from the domestic ida of men being the ruler of the house and family, but has expanded and
		are very present in contemporary society and how it is structured. The term has often been used by Second-wave feminists
		and has been defined as "a system of social structures and practices in which men dominate, oppress, and exploit women."
		<br />
		(Walby, Sylvia (1989). "Theorising Patriarchy")
		</span>
</span>


for having that assumption, but I’m saying that, you, as
many others, have become a victim of the patriarchal dominant master
narrative — and to be fair, it’s hard not to be, since it is so deeply
rooted within history. I, myself, didn’t think of the berry pickers and
basket makers either.
<br />
<br />
To make an emphasis on the male-controlled — and navigated — narrative, I’m
going to stay with the discourse of prehistoric times. It is said that
the oldest find of cave art, mainly consist of <button class="button1 image-toggle" data-image-id="image-20">depictions of the female
	sexual organ</button> and various preys.<span class="reference-toggle">&nbsp;&#x27A5;</span>

			</p>
		  </div>
		</p>

<p>

	Professor R. Dale Guthrie speculates, that
cave art has been a more personal outlet, and less about rituals or collective
moments, which some professionals have suggested in other theories. Guthrie also states that
<button class="button1 image-toggle" data-image-id="image-21">cave
art</button> is believed to primarily be made by young men. Young men who
experienced a high increase in thoughts of their upcoming adult life —
combined with some curiosity — which apparently — and not hard to imagine
when you think about the stereotypical gender roles — led them to have
nothing else on their mind than sex and hunting and suddenly the cave
art turned into a <span class="quote">“…Paleolithic playboy magazine”.</span>

		</p>


<p>
<br/>


And then even prehistoric times prove to tap into the male gaze <span class="sidenote-wrapper">
    <input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-checkbox" />
    <label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"> </label>
    <span class="sidenote">A feministic theory that describes the act of 
		sexualizing women for the satisfaction of the cis male viewer, which can cause women to be

		Term is mostly used in the realm of visual arts and literature and is strongly related to the patriarchy.
		</span>
</span> and tells us the story, that (most) men have been so comfortable within the
narrative, that they don’t have the need to progress — though they did
evolve from the stages of cave art. Or did they?

	

<span class="italic">In my humble opinion it still seems like the male gender use
their reproductive organs as their moral compass to navigate through the
world.
</span>

<br />
<br />

If you need a scapegoat for this theory, one could be Plato. Plato
understood the importance of storytelling, which for the concern of this
thesis feels a bit contradictory. In the book Republic

<span class="sidenote-wrapper">
    <input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-checkbox" />
    <label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"> </label>
    <span class="sidenote">Republic is a series of dialogues between Socrates 
		and other important male figures. The dialogues are mostly 
		concerned about political theory, justice, and how to become the ideal man. 
		The publication is narrated by Plato and his believes are therfor also very present.
		</span>
</span>




it’s discussed how to use and
moderate storytelling, in the benefit of the political goal and power.
And further on the perception, that the tool of stories and myths should
only concern Gods and heroes, due to the idea that people need
aspiration and a form of image to the perfect. By having this they would
have a clear vision on what was thought on to be the ideal man, the
hero, which then can be imitated.<span class="reference-toggle">&nbsp;&#x27A5;</span>
<span class="reference">(Durec, <em>Shaping Imaginations:
	Plato's Republic on Stories and Storytelling</em>)</span> 
So you might not like the fascist approach of controlling the narrative, but it’s another
argument, why storytelling is such a powerful tool.
<br/>
<br/>
By now the narrative of this thesis is becoming a very
one-sided way of storytelling. Storytelling is of course more than the
retelling of the past or to read about it in written words or found books. 
<br/>
<br/>
With the development of how society are structured today — especially with all the
different tyoes of medias — storytelling is way more diversified than in earlier epochs, 
and stories are mediated
through everything from bedtime stories, images (still and moving),
activism, to even social platforms.<span class="reference-toggle">&nbsp;&#x27A5;</span>
<span class="reference">(Sontag and Berger, <em>To Tell a
	Story</em>)</span> 
Stories are not universal in the sense, that we alle share the
same story or perception of the story. Our perception are shaped by our
individual experiences, which is why we never will reach a perfect common
ground on how we read and understand the world — or the master narrative.
But event without shareinmg the same perception of the already told stories, 
I believe it’s safe to assume that we are all familiar with storytelling
as a tool. A tool of learning. To learn about the past, cultures, and
our social surroundings. But we might be less familiar with the idea of
using storytelling to change the master narrative — or the world so to
say.
<br />
<br />




According to <button class="button1 image-toggle" data-image-id="image-22">Aristotle</button> a narrative connects events, it doesn’t matter if
the narrative follows a classic pattern of beginning, middle, ending or
being non-linear — a narrative will always resemble a journey.<span class="reference-toggle">&nbsp;&#x27A5;</span>
<span class="reference">(Le Guin, <em>Dancing at the Edge of the World: Thoughts on Words, Women,
	Places</em>)</span> 
 Stories, especially the ones that stems from oral
tradition, are peoples own description of themselves and their way of
facing life. These descriptions often differ from descriptions made by
professionals such as sociologists, scientists, or
anthropologists.
</p>

		</p>
	  </div>
	</p>
	
<p>
And even though there might be a slight distortion, or untruth in
people’s self-image through storytelling, there is no need to believe
that a professional who studies culture through their own perception of
life, should have a more truthful image of another person and their
culture.<span class="reference-toggle">&#x27A5;</span>
<span class="reference">(Bronner, "Folklore as a Mirror of Culture")</span>


That idea becomes
more and more absurd the more you think about it, due to the gap there
is between reality and perception, a gap that allows interfering and
creates room for change. <span class="reference-toggle">&nbsp;&#x27A5;</span>
<span class="reference">(Tiffee, "Mind the Gap Between Perception and
	Reality")</span> 


<br />
<br />

The question is now; how can the story be rewritten? How to detangle the
master narrative, for then to weave in new and unheard voices that didn’t
get the change to affect the narrative in the past.

<span class="italic">By now you must have realised, that equality simply does not
exist — at least not in this time or world. This statement might seem hard or definitive, but by making this 
statement I create yet
another gap. 
<br />
<br />
This gap, gives you the necessary space that allows you to fill it up with your own peception of the given matter. It allows you 
to either oppose or agree, or be somewhere in the middle.
<br />
<br />
For now and for the sake of the upcoming words, I rely on, that you can agree with me without too many
questions — it would simply take up too much of the collected word count
to explain in the details of this statement. 
<br />
<br />
But what I will do, is to put the statement into the context (or container if you will)
of storytelling and fiction.
</span>

<br />
<br />

The individual human will always be its own protagonist, our
perception of challenges and unfairness of the world are defined by our
own personal standpoint, we can’t experience what others are
experiencing. Neither can we fully experience what have already
happened. The only thing to we can do is to navigate in the aftermath of
it and explore the results of how the story has played out so far. There
is a duality in this that is challenging for very different reasons 1)
It takes great courage to share a story, even if it doesn’t contain any
trauma or violence. But maybe even the smallest urge to share a story,
means that no one else has done it yet, and that can feel lonesome. 2)
To be the receiver and to fully listen and reflect upon it is difficult.
As mentioned, you can’t fully experience other people’s experiences, and
this can lead the recipient to fully miscomprehend.
</p>
<p>
But, to somehow get closer to full equality, we must practice both
parameters of it. Imagine a world where it has been led by people who
fully understood the female experience — we might wouldn’t even had to
talk about it by now.

<br />
<br />



Being a woman in this time era — I’m not even aware if we are in the
beginning, middle or at the end of the story — at times, it feels like we
are getting closer to the end. Some argue that this epoch we live in at
this time, is the Anthropocene.

way pass irreversible. It has this doomsday notion and suddenly I’m
thinking the rhetoric about this epoch is why it feels like we are

has been suggested and it is argued that we should not blame the individual
human but see the alarming climate changes more as a systematic flaw,
also known as capitalism. And just by a change of epoch we prove that we
just not yet are at the very end.


<br />

<br />

So, for the sake of ongoingness and the Capitalocene, I’m going
to drift the focus back to The Life Story. The story that has been put

Placed in the back of the fridge and now, no one dares to open it
anymore. Too terrified to be hit in the face with a pungent smell that
triggers something uncomfortable — and why put yourself in that situation?
What really is going to happen — if you are brave enough to open the
lid — is that the oxygen will feed the story and the energy will make the
threads of it grow. It will then become bigger and spread wider than
before.
</p>

<p>
The author Saidiya Hartman refers to the notion of opening the lid,
or mining the gap, as critical fabulation. A term that describes a
creative method of combining history with fiction, and to explore the
narrative that already took place.<span class="reference-toggle">&nbsp;&#x27A5;</span>
<span class="reference">(Okeowo, "How Saidiya Hartman Retells
	the History of Black Life")</span> 

Hartman’s essay <em>Venus in Two Acts</em>
is a story of two enslaved black girls. The fragments that Hartman uses
are from the archive of Atlantic slavery which consists of no more than
legal documents, protocols and account books stating their death and
identifying them as nothing more than numbers.

<span class="reference-toggle">&#x27A5;</span>
<span class="reference">(Hartman, "Venus in Two
	Acts")</span> 
 When Hartman starts to read the archives, she opens the lid of
the container, and by doing so being faced with the position of the
archive, institutionalised, powerful and by that being the curator of
the knowledge of the past. Due to this notion Hartman was urged to write
a counter-story, a story that empowered the unheard voices in the
narrative. In this case, the story of the two enslaved girls.
<span class="reference-toggle">&nbsp;&#x27A5;</span>
<span class="reference">(Ibid.)</span> 


But how do we place ourselves in the act of telling other people’s
stories?</p>


<p>Hartman herself questions <span class="quote">“How can narrative embody life in words
and at the same time respect what we cannot know?”.</span>
<span class="reference-toggle">&nbsp;&#x27A5;</span>
<span class="reference">(Ibid. p. 14)</span> 

She also poses the indication, that the fiction and writing from her, is
not about filling in the gaps and create a new master narrative. But
rather to create a fuller picture of the life of the girls, to focus on
<em>The Life Story</em> and not to make an uplifting heroine story about
slavery, but to make sure that words from a slave holds the same value
in the greater narrative, as a scholarly philosopher.
</span>
<span class="reference-toggle">&#x27A5;</span>
<span class="reference">(Okeowo, "How
	saidiya Hartman Retells the History of Black Life")</span> 

<br />
<br />

Critical fabulation is essentially a creative act of reading into an
archive — or multiple — collecting the fragments of spoken objects and
documents, and by then create a narrative exploring the unwanted voices
of the story. In order for you to practice this act, you will need an archive.
<br />
<br />

The traditional concept of an archive is explained by Jacques Derrida
to be rooted in the Greek antiquity and had close connection with the
power and politics of the community.
<span class="reference-toggle">&#x27A5;</span>
<span class="reference">(Derrida and Prenowitz, "Archive
	Fever: A Freudian Impression")</span> 

This concept, is to this day still the
building blocks of the traditional archives



<span class="sidenote-wrapper">
	<input type="checkbox" id="sn-9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-checkbox" />
	<label for="sn-9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"> </label>
	<span class="sidenote">The idea of the traditional archives 
		is meant to be read as; archives that are situated and rooted in a physical space 
		and are focused on keeping — and storing — information on historically collections about given cultures. 
		</span>
</span>

— the archives that we in contemporary times tend to rely on for seeking
answers of the past. The idea of this kind of archive is a significant
factor that should be taken into consideration when discussing archived
material and the inclusivity of it.
</p>

<p> 
Further on Derrida opens to the
complexity of the physical space of the archive, and how this has
evolved simultaneously with the development of society and
technology.<span class="reference-toggle">&nbsp;&#x27A5;</span>
<span class="reference">(Ibid.)</span> 

<br />
<br />

And with that being the starting point in the
discussion of the definition and the role of the archive in
storytelling, I want to challenge the idea of the archive and what it
can be. Could it be the mouldy bread or maybe the unopened
Tupperware?

My archive doesn’t have a system, everything gets thrown

everything sloshes around and tangles up — growing in and out of each

Joanna Russ once wrote a letter to feminist literary historian and

<span class="reference">(Russ, <em>How to Suppress Women’s Writing</em>)</span> 
— well in general, the female experience has been expressed through all kinds of
media as being rather difficult — returning to history, the female
experience have been automatically devaluated and considered to be more
narrow than the male experience, the master narrative has — so far — been too
absorbed by men and their God/hero complex

<span class="reference">(Chesler, <em>About Men</em>, p. 205)</span> 

<br />
<br />

Joanna Russ, mostly known for her writings in the genre of science
fiction, has written a (novelle) where she with sarcasm — and deeply
rooted anger and frustration maps out a tool of analytics to acknowledge
the patterns of suppression, in the field of writing. The cover of the
book is plastered with quotes that all begins with <span class="quote">“She wrote it,
but…”</span> <span class="reference-toggle">&nbsp;&#x27A5;</span>
<span class="reference">(Russ, <em>How to Suppress Women’s Writing</em>)</span> which could suggest that
Russ is only referring to the writing by women. Though, this is not the case, Russ' tool is about equality.
<br />
<br />
In the prologue Russ makes use of the tools of SF

<span class="sidenote-wrapper">
	<input type="checkbox" id="sn-11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-checkbox" />
	<label for="sn-11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"> </label>
	<span class="sidenote">A gentle reminder on the intended meanin behind SF.

</span>

and writes about the Glotologs

<span class="sidenote-wrapper">
	<input type="checkbox" id="sn-11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-checkbox" />
	<label for="sn-11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"> </label>
	<span class="sidenote">	A tool of SF. Glotologs are here used to name the dominant and controlling individuals
		of the history in arts. In this contextis meant white cis men.
		</span>
</span>


— being an intergalactic
creature, judging what and who can make art, and how to keep certain
groups away from the art <span class="quote">“In normally egalitarian society the ideal
situation (socially speaking) is one in which the members of the ‘wrong’
groups have the freedom to engage in literature (or equally significant
activities) and yet do not do so, thus proving that they can’t.”</span>
	<span class="reference-toggle">&nbsp;&#x27A5;</span>
	<span class="reference">(Ibid. p. 4)</span>
</p>

<p>
The tools of Russ’ analytic toolkit can also be applied to other
forms of arts than just writing, and with the power of storytelling
being incredible diversified, it seems fitting to look into how
storytelling has been used as a tool other than fiction. A great axample could be in activism.
Where the fight is often between a them and us. It is important to understand your toolkit and what
the power of the tools can be utilised to your own benefit. By asking yourself; who
do you want to listen to you? This can become the difference between
success and failure to get your message through or not.

	<span class="sidenote">An anonymous actvistic group of feminist artists that are dedicated

		</span>
</span>

is an activistic group who actively make use of tools in their communication,
some of them that resembles the same tools we acknowledge being used in
fiction. As an example, their decision to use physical gorilla masks,
which does not only provide them privacy, but helps them to emphasise
the issue of their activism, instead of focusing on their personal
character. But also, the mask, provides a humoristic aspect to their
campaigning, that involves people more.<span class="reference-toggle">&nbsp;&#x27A5;</span>
<span class="reference">(Chadwick and Guerrilla Girls,
	<em>Confessions of the Guerrilla Girls</em>)</span>


This also suggest that humour is being used as a tool to get rid of the (at the time) notion
that feminists didn’t have any sense of fun and being a rather stuck up
group of people.
</p>
<p>


Even though the use of gorilla mask seems as a simple
gesture, it can be interpreted in so many ways, Guerilla Girls
themselves have stated, that it also made them step into a line of,
traditionally male and masked heroes, such as Robin, Batman and
Spiderman. In their own words this helped them gain some sort of
<span class="quote">“mask-ulinity.”</span><span class="reference-toggle">&nbsp;&#x27A5;</span>
<span class="reference">(Ibid. p. 15)</span>

</br>
</br>
And yet again we are witnessing the unwanted voices of our society to
be experts in the act of shapeshifting. Indirectly asked to constantly
analyse the room — and figure out how to fit in. But the room never take
shape after us, and if after all if it does happen, it is with a
resistant attitude and an expectation of a sincere and praised
thank you. <span class="italic">I’m like a scoby, a Vinegar Mother, feed me with oxygen and
sugar to keep me alive. I will only take the room you offer. My
experience are the ingredients that nurtures me and make sure I grow — and
the world is my container. 
</br>
</br>
But what you don’t know, is what happens if
you don’t take care of me. If you forget about me and keep me contained
in the dark for too long.
</br>
</br>
The process of turning sugar into anger will begin.
</br>
</br>
A chemical process that can’t be stopped, and the longer you wait
to check up on me, the more my anger will ferment. Like gas, it will
infiltrate every memory and experience, becoming paramount and if you
ever decide to open the lid — I will for sure explode.</span>
</br>
</br>
Hopefully we are looking into another epoch, even just for the sake of the
changes that comes with it. I just read an essay that suggests that the
next era in time should be named the Gynocene.<span class="reference-toggle">&nbsp;&#x27A5;</span>
<span class="reference">(Van Der Bly, "Welcome to
	the Gynocene")</span> A suggestion that refers to the inequality between
genders and how the all the epochs we have lived so far, have been

</span>

suggests that the earth can’t be healed unless the inequality between male and
unwanted voices are healed.<span class="reference-toggle">&nbsp;&#x27A5;</span>
<span class="reference">(Ibid.)</span>

<br />
<br />

But how to do so, and how can stories contribute to the healing of this
inequality? Le Guin refers to the power of language and how we in school
are taught the language spoken by white men — also referred to as father
tongue. It is a useful language that communicates power and knowledge,
but also spoken from above with no answer expected <span class="quote">"White man speak
dichotomy”</span> <span class="reference-toggle">&#x27A5;</span>
<span class="reference">(Ursula K. Le Guin, Bryn Mawr Commencement Address)</span> 
and creates the gaps, this language decides what is right and what is wrong
and emphasise the notion of <em>us</em> and <em>them.</em> On the other
hand, there is mother tongue, the language of connection, relations and
emotions, the language that goes two ways while entangling itself in the
web of sharing and listening. Mother tongue is the language that stories
are spoken in, and offers experiences as being the truth. Le Guin
continues and emphasises the importance of understanding the power of
both the languages,<span class="reference-toggle">&nbsp;&#x27A5;</span>
<span class="reference">(Ibid.)</span> by understanding how to make use of both the
tongues, the gap of inequality might slowly start to close up. It’s like
an alchemical marriage between the sun and the moon as soon as they
become a union the balance will be restored — or at least that the
idea. 

<br />
<br />

Coming back to how this relates to storytelling and the female
experience is to stress power the story holds, even it being fiction.
Focusing on the written aspect of storytelling I am going to refer to
yet another female author and her perspective on why she writes. Joan
Didion describes writing as an act of saying I, to share experience and
invade the reader’s most intimate space. <span class="quote">“In many ways, writing is
the act of saying I, of imposing oneself upon other people, of
saying  listen to me, see it my way, change your mind. It’s an
aggressive, even a hostile act.”</span><span class="reference-toggle">&nbsp;&#x27A5;</span>
<span class="reference">(Didion, "Why I Write”)</span>

And with this amazing quote I’m going to stop the invasion of your intimate
space, give you a rest and some space to breath and reflect on how your
story fits into the master narrative of the world.

<div id="Conclusion" class="middle-container">	

<span class="headline">TO TANGLE IT UP AGAIN</span>	
<br />
<br />
<p>
The analogy of mould in a loaf of bread captures the nature of
storytelling. Just like an airborne fungus, that with an immense speed,
travel through the gaps of air in the porous body of the bread — stories
that are spoken, written, and brought to life acts the same. As soon as
the stories comes to life, they will immediately infiltrate the gaps of
the untold and create entanglements with the master narrative of the
world. Sometimes the strings of the stories are going to be visible and
other times most of us won’t even notice the newly created web in the
narrative.

<br />
<br />

Ursula K. Le Guin’s <em>The Carrier Bag of Fiction</em> speaks of the
notion of the first manmade tool being a container, rather than a
weapon, and continues with expanding the idea of what a container is. Le
Guin argues that the novelle also can be considered a container, that
holds the power of words. The novelle diviates from the idea that every
story needs a hero, but the world are in need of the stories told in
mother tongue and with real people, also referred to as The Life Story.
With a point of departure in this notion the thesis continously explores
different ways of using storytelling as a tool of healing the master
narrative. Saydiya Hartman’s critcal fabulation are using the fragmented
archives to mine the gaps of the history and by use of tools of fiction,
Hartman are giving back the voices to the oppressed of the history. Or
with Guerilla Girls who are making use of gorilla masks in order to be
more accomodating to the outside world, and hopefully removing the idea
of feminist being up tight.

<br />
<br />

As we entangle ourselves into the speculative realm, contemplating the
next epoch as suggested by Martha Van Der Bly – the Gynocene – a era where
women, shapeshifters, and other unwanted voices are not only living in
the world made by men, but are a part of creating the world. The
suggestion is that the Earth can only heal when the inequality between
male and unwanted voices is addressed opens the door to the
transformative potential of storytelling.

<br />
<br />

Through this exploring I have been actively searching for argument that
contained the importance of storytelling and fiction, and how this is
dominated by The Killer Story. Through my research and writing I have
become increasable more and more frustrate, every new knowledge and
text, was getting thrown into my personal archive and by laying around
there tangled up in each other, my research started to grow and ferment.
The result of this process is this thesis, that with a great personal
angle, maps out the use of storytelling, language and novelle and how I
since the beginning of human life, have been used to shape the
world.</p>
